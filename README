This is the repository for the tomahawk resolvers that are automatically exposed in Tomahawk through KDE's Synchrotron.

Resolvers are manually pushed / upgraded here, and Tomahawk users will be able to install them directly from Tomahawk.

To update the binary resolvers (at the moment, spotify-osx and spotify-win), use the create_synchrotron.rb script in 
admin/{mac|win}/ in the tomahawk-resolvers repo.
